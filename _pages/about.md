Salut! My name is Fred. I am another French living Down Under. I am a dedicated and motivated data scientist with a strong background in Physics and Statistical Analysis, as well as a PhD in Astrophysics. I spent time perfecting my knowledge about the Cosmos. Sadly, I did not mastered the <a href="https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sense#The_Seventh_Sense">Seventh and Eight Senses</a>.

However, my years in Academia have taught me how to approach complex problems with a critical eye and a rigorous methodology. Since starting my career as a data scientist in May 2021, I have been applying these skills to help organizations make data-driven decisions and improve their business outcomes.

In addition to my focus on Data Science, I have recently begun to explore general software engineering principles. Specifically, I have been working on my web development skills using Ruby on Rails. Overall, I am eager to continue to learn and grow in a role as a data scientist and software engineer while having a positive societal impact.
