Salut! My name is Fred. I am another French living Down Under. Until recently, I was a Research Scientist at the <a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/"> Centre for Astronomy and Supercomputing at <a href="https://www.swinburne.edu.au/science-engineering-technology/">Swinburne University of Technology</a>. 

There I spent time perfecting my knowledge about the Cosmos. Sadly, I did not mastered the <a href="https://saintseiya.fandom.com/wiki/Sense#The_Seventh_Sense">Seventh and Eight Senses</a> but I did learn quite a bit about Observational Astronomy, Quasar Spectroscopy, and the metallic enrichment of the gaseous structures. 

I am interested about Science and, since I spent a lot of my time behind a computer, programming in general. My life's goal is to positive societal impact by using all of the skills I have learned throughout my life.
