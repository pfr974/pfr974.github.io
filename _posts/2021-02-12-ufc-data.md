I have finally decided to give a go at Tableau recently completed the first part of a course on Udemy: [Tableau 2020 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training for Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/tableau10/). Before starting the second part, [Tableau 20 Advanced Training: Master Tableau in Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/tableau10-advanced/), I wanted to play with some new data and apply what I have learned. Since I am a big combat sports enthusiast, I decided to focus this project on the [Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)](https://www.ufc.com/).

I recently came across different datasets with a lot of relevant stats for all the fights that have happened in the UFC. The data were obtained using a web scraper, more precisely a Scrapy spider crawling [ufcstats.com](http://ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed). I wish I was the one that wrote that scraper but all credits due to [fanghuiz](https://github.com/fanghuiz/ufc-stats-crawler). As stated in the readme of the repository, note that the current version of the scraper will crawl the entire website, so it might take some time. For those who wish to get the data but not to run the different spiders, feel free to download them from [my repository](https://github.com/pfr974/ufc_project), Check the file <code>ufcFightStats_formatted.csv</code> and <code>ufcFightInfos.csv</code>. Now allow me to run you through some details:

In fanghuiz's repository, there are 3 spiders:
- <code><i>ufcFights</i></code>
- <code><i>ufcFighters</i></code>
- <code><i>upcoming</i></code>

The <code><i>ufcFights</i></code> spider returns fight’s data and store them in a <code>.csv</code> file and a <code>.jl</code> (newline-delimited JSON) file: <code>ufcFightInfos.csv</code> and <code>2021-02-11T00-34-21.jl</code>. The <code>.csv</code> ccontains the fight’s metadata: event data, event location, the matchup for a fight,  fighters' name, winner, etc. The <code>.jl</code> contains stats for every fights: significant strikes attempted, significant strikes landed, takedown, etc.

The <code><i>ufcFighters</i></code> spider returns fighter's career stats and stores them in a .csv file: reach, height, current weight class, stance, significant strikes landed per minute, etc.

The <code><i>upcoming</i></code> spider returns matchup metadata for an upcoming event: date, fight’s id, red corner’s name, red corner’s id, blue corner’s name, blue corner’s id, location, and weight class.

The first spider is more interesting than the rest for me. Yet, if exploring the file with the fight’s metadata with Tableau went fine, I can’t say the same with the <code>.jl</code> one. Tableau does not read <code>.jl</code> files. So I first thought of simply converting it to a readable format like CSV with <code>pandas.DataFrame.to_csv</code>:

```python
import pandas as pd
import json
import requests

with open('2021-02-11T00-34-21.jl') as f:
    lines = f.read().splitlines()

df_inter = pd.DataFrame(lines)
df_inter.columns = ['json_element']
df_inter['json_element'].apply(json.loads)
df_final = pd.json_normalize(df_inter['json_element'].apply(json.loads))
df_final.to_csv('ufcFights.csv',index=False)
```

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    First version of the data table.
</div>

However, I didn’t take into account the content of the cells. If you look at the screenshots above you can see that all of the cells, except <b>fight_id</b>, contain a list of 2 elements. For instance, the <b>fighter_name</b> cell’s value for the first row is <code>['Ode Osbourne','Jerome Rivera']</code>. What I would like to have is one element per cell. We would want to split a row with information about fighter 1 and fighter 2 into 2. The only element they would have in common would then be <b>fight_id</b>. Fortunately, pandas has a method called <code><b>pandas.DataFrame.explode</b></code> that transforms each element of a list-like to a row. Using this method, I was able to format my table into something more of my liking:

```python         
import pandas as pd
import json
import requests
import numpy as np
from ast import literal_eval

def format_dataframe(df,terms):
    for term in terms:
        df[term] = df[term].apply(literal_eval)
    return df

terms = {'fighter_id','fighter_name','fighter_status','kd','n_pass',
         'n_sub','sig_str_abs','sig_str_att','sig_str_def','sig_str_land',
         'total_str_abs','total_str_att','total_str_def','total_str_land','td_abs',
         'td_att','td_def','td_land','head_abs','head_att',
         'head_def','head_land','body_abs','body_att','body_def',
         'body_land','leg_abs','leg_att','leg_def','leg_land',
         'distance_abs','distance_att','distance_def','distance_land','clinch_abs',
         'clinch_att','clinch_def','clinch_land','ground_abs','ground_att',
         'ground_def','ground_land'}
df = pd.read_csv('ufcFights.csv')
df = df.dropna() #Let's get rid of the fights with no stats
df = format_dataframe(df,terms)
df = df.apply(lambda x: x.explode() if x.name in terms else x)
```

Now, it is much easier to navigate through the file with Tableau. For instance, it was really easy to obtain this plot.

    Max Holloway vs The rest of the UFC. The best is really blessed ✧٩(•́⌄•́๑).
</div>

This scatterplot shows numbers of significant strikes attempted vs significant strikes landed for every fighter. Different versions of this plot were shared on social media after an incredible performance of my favourite fighter [Max "Blessed" Holloway](https://www.ufc.com/athlete/max-holloway). In his most recent fight against Kelvin Kattar, he landed 445 significant strikes out of 744 over five rounds! That is a crazy number and because of it, Max Holloway can be spotted straight away on the plot: he is an outlier! This fight and the one against Brian Ortega set him apart from the rest of the UFC!

What started as a quick way to play around with Tableau turned into a much more fun project. I am looking forwards to exploring more of these UFC’s data!
